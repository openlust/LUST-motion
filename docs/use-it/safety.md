## Safety Warnings

!!! danger "Do not use on persons with medical implants!"

    Do not use on persons which have a implanted metallic or electronic device. E.g. Pace maker, heart monitor, defibrillator, cochlea implant, stents, metallic bone implants, etc.

!!! danger "Do not use on the following persons!"

    - Do not use on pregnant woman.
    - Do not use on persons with a known or suspected heart condition.
    - Do not use on persons diagnosed with epilepsy.

!!! danger "No stimulation on / through the head!"

    Do not apply the device on the head with current flowing through the head, face, mouth or eyes. This may lead to permanent damage.

!!! danger "No stimulation on front of the throat!"

    Do not stimulate the front of the throat. The carotid sinus reflex might get triggered leading to sudden drop in blood pressure knocking out the user.

!!! danger "No stimulation across the heart!"

    Current flow across the heart must be avoided. No placing of electrodes on the chest and the back, breast to breast or hand to hand.

!!! danger "Do not use the device under the following conditions!"

    - While driving a car
    - While operating heavy machinery

    Muscle spasms or a surprising shocks could lead to severe accidents.

!!! warning

    Electrodes near the heart pose a risk for ventricular fibrillation.

!!! warning

    Current densities over 10 mA RMS or 2 mA/cm² (e.g. small electrode surfaces like needles, piercings, etc.) could lead to electrical burns or violent muscle contractions and need special attention by the operator.

!!! warning

    The device may cause powerful muscle contractions. This may result in injuries through striking of nearby objects, falling over, muscle soreness, overstress of tendons or even fractured bones.

!!! warning

    Noisy Cricket is not a medical device and must be used for recreational use only.

!!! warning

    By design the output stage has a significantly lower internal resistance than most competing devices. Even with very low impedance electrodes (e.g. large metal insertables) the output voltage will not sag. This makes the stimulation on this type of electrode in particular strong and requires careful oversight.
