# Pattern

The symbol :material-lightning-bolt: denotes a pattern that uses a boosted pulse width of up to 200%. Mostly this is used to create a very sharp zappy effect when a pulse sequence starts.

## Continuous Pattern

Continuously running cyclic pattern always use the base voltage for the stimulation and may not alter or change this voltage at all. To achieve different perceived intensities they only use pulse width and pulse rate. As additional ways to alter the feeling two parameters called `Sensation` and `Speed` are available. How they act specifically is described for each pattern. Generally `Sensation` alters the feel (pulse rate in most pattern), whereas `Speed` is used to change the speed of a pattern.

## One-Shot Burst Pattern

One-Shot burst can be used to send signals or as interesting variations to the play. They change the base voltage by a certain percentage up or down. The second parameter is the duration of the one-shot burst which can be up to 10 seconds. The selected pattern is than stretched to meet this duration target. While they preempt all other stimulations, all bursts commands are queued and executed in the sequence they have been received.

They main appeal of one-shot burst pattern is their ability to be triggered automatically by internal sensor events (actions) to enable interesting play scenarios.
